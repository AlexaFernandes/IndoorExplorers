# IndoorExplorers
This is OpenAI Gym environemnt developed for my Master's dissertation. 
It provides a framework for testing RL algorithms in a multi-agent exploration scenario, in unknown areas.
Each agent has a limited field of vision by an emulated LiDAR sensor, and agents may or may not have a limited communication range.
